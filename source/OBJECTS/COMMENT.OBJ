;                            are handled specially.  The first OID entry
;                            is 2 integers, the first contains the total
;                            number of OIDs in this structure, the second
;                            is the total number of array segments.  Each

;                            the array has the object type to avoid
;                            opening the target object just to check if
;                            it is the desired type.  This creates redun-
;                            dancy that is not desired.
