;           The KEY of each entry in the deletion index is the object
;           type, which is a 1/2 word, and the OID of the object to be
;           deleted.  Items that appear in this index are only deleted
;           from the object level, not the data base.
;
;           The data of each deletion entry is the date and time of
;           deletion and the OID of the user or process that requested
;           the deletion.
