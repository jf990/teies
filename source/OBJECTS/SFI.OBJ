;To find the form for a given state of TEIES, pass the state as the
;key to SFI.INDEX.STATEID.  The state is a 4 byte binary number.  If
;the associated entry is found in the SFI, the OCD will be an OCD
; string containing the NDX segment under the OID where the Form is.  If
;this is a NULL string, the OID is not a TEIES OID but rather an 8
;character file name whose extension (file type) is assumed to be FORM.
;The FORMID string is the TEIES user interface id that is supposed to
;appear in the upper right corner of each screen (this is 8 bytes).
