;   The SYSTEM object definition is a set of components that all objects
;   include through heredity.  The only exception to this rule are the
;   System Objects (SYSNDX) as they do not include system components.
;
;   Typically, System Components are only available to the Master Server.
;   a user or programmer does not have access to this information.  When
;   an object is sent to a user server the System Components are not sent.
;
;   The first Root Segment entry defines all the linkages of this object.
;   Object ID's (OID's) are stored with the object instance that point to
;   both forward and backward linkages.  The second Root Segment entry
;   contains non-linkage information that is maintained by the Master
;   Server.

;                            are handled specially.  The first OID entry
;                            is 2 integers, the first contains the total
;                            number of OIDs in this structure, the second
;                            is the total number of array segments.  Each

;                            the array has the object type to avoid
